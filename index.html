                            I'm a Systems Safety Engineer in the Bay Area, supporting the build of an autonomous air taxi. I have a Master's in Aerospace Engineering degree from Georgia Tech, where my research focused primarily on Systems Engineering for aircraft cabins and sat constellations. I hope to gain a diverse range of career experiences in engineering and project management to help advance our <span class="emphasis">exploration of the skies and beyond.</span><br><br>
                            I'm a strong advocate for inclusion and equity within the industry and dedicate much time outside of work to DEI and STEM outreach initiatives. I also enjoy coding, CADing and cafe hopping.

Their first mission to the lunar surface the Hakuto-R M1 ended up in loss of communication during the final descent, resulting in a hard landing. The Hakuto-R M2 is currently in orbit heading to the Moon.</li>

Supersonic commercial travel ended with the demise of the British/French Concorde aircraft in 2003 due to two tragic accidents and the high cost of development and maintenance. Boom's Overture intends to bring back supersonic travel by 2027. Boom recently completed it's first supersonic flight test of the XB-1 (or Baby Boom), a one-third scale demonstrator aircraft. If this happens I'll be able to reach my home country in around 8 hours (instead of 24).</li>
                            <li style="margin-bottom: 50px;"><span style="color: #780000"><strong>Digantara</strong></span> is an Indian space startup building a catalogue of Space Situational Awareness data to provide insights for safe and sustainable space operations. As LEO grows congested and contested, and the fear of space debris lingers overhead, the need of such "maps" to track objects and debris, is crucial to continue utilization of space to improve life on Earth.  </li>
                            <li style="margin-bottom: 50px;"><span style="color: #780000"><strong>Planet Labs</strong></span> needs no introduction. If SpaceX democratized our access to space, Planet revolutionized the way we observed the Earth from orbit. Planet builds cheap, reliable and frequent launched satellites that image the Earth daily and enable real time monitoring for a multitude of applications</li>
